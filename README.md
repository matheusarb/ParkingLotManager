## :bulb: Tips on how to use it
* This project is intended to simulate the backend of a parking lot workflow via API requests
* The ParkingLotManager.WebApi is fully documented, where you can find all the information about each endpoint and what it does
* You can run the script.sql to add entries to your database
* RBAC is binded to be used on GetFordBrand endpoint(Vehicles/GetFordBrand). First, you need to create an admin user(Account/CreateAdmin) and log in (Account/Login). You will receive a Bearer Token which is needed in the request.
  * Pass the Bearer Token in the "Authorization" tab on Postman. Select Type "Bearer Token"
  * Before sending a request make sure you have at least one vehicle which "brand" is "Ford"
